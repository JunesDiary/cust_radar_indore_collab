Work under the collaboration of Calcutta University and IIT-Indore


1. Offline Work begins 7th October, 2022. 

   - First Meeting: Date - 7:30 AM IST, 8th October, 2022. Agenda: CU-ST Radar, a preview as a Passive Antenna.
   
2. Antenna Measurements and Designing Task (as an exercise) (Date - 11th October, 2022). 

   - Performed Antenna Measurement for a 4GHz C Band Horn Antenna. 
   - Designing of Parabolic Reflector Antenna with Horn feed and Dipole Feed in CST MIcrowave Studio (Student version) and MATLAB. Files are attached as code.
   
3. Passive Mode Operation of ST Radar (Date - 12th and 13th October, 2022).

   - Studying the CU-ST Radar Electronics for performing Sun Tracking Experiment.
   - Working on best possible dates for solar tracking by finding the elevation and azimuth of sun in the month of October. Using Reference Site: https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1224682277
   - Produced a experiment scheme on how to perform the experiment for 15th October, 2022 for sun tracking with single beam for tracking.
   - Second meeting: Date: 9:00 PM IST, 13th October, 2022. Agenda: Single and multi point sun-tracking using single beam in DBS Mode at CU-ST Radar.
